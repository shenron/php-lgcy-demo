# Demo Legacy PHP Project

The idea is not to create the best setup. But the easiest.  
It's not because it's a "legacy" template that the structure has to be a nightmare.

How Start?: run `./start.sh`

Few rules

*   Create a **statics** folder with all statics (images, css, etc ...)
*   Create a **pages** folder for all "real" PHP pages
*   Extract the business part (here common.php)
*   Use environment variable to store credendials

Let's go! The [first pages is available](./pages/index.php).  
And a [form example](./pages/form.php).
